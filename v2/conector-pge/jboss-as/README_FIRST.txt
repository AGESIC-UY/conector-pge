Welcome to JBossESB. In order to get you started, we recommend that you look
first at the Getting Started Guide in docs before then proceeding to the various
Quick Start examples in the samples directory. Once you have progressed through
these, the Trailblazer example (also in the samples directory) is an excellent way
of bringing together the various components and lessons learnt.

Don't forget, if you have any questions or comments about JBossESB, please go to
the forum (http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&op=viewforum&f=246) where we
will respond as soon as possible.
